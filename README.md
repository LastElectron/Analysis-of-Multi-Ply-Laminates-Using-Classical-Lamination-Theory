## Project Overview
This term project focuses on the detailed analysis and evaluation of composite laminates using advanced computational methods. The project aims to determine the effective properties of composite laminates based on their layer angles and configurations. It involves calculating the stress and strain in each individual layer of the laminate, plotting these parameters along the laminate's thickness, and evaluating the laminate's safety using the Hoffmann criteria. Additionally, the project assesses the margin of safety to verify that the laminate design adheres to required safety standards.

## Project Objectives
- **Calculate Effective Properties**: Determine the effective properties of lamina, including modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio, by analyzing the laminate's configuration and material properties.
- **Stress and Strain Analysis**: Analyze and compute the stress and strain distributions in each layer of the laminate, taking into account the laminate angles and applied loading conditions.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize the variations in stress and strain along the thickness of the laminate.
- **Safety Assessment**: Use the Hoffmann criteria to evaluate the safety of the laminate and calculate the margin of safety to ensure the laminate's performance meets safety requirements under specified loads.
